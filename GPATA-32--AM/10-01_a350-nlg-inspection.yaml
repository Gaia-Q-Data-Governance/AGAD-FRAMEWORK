    - step: 8
      text: Check all hydraulic lines and electrical wiring for chafing, leaks, or damage.
      substeps:
      - Inspect Yellow hydraulic system connections.
      - Inspect Green hydraulic system connections.
      - Check proximity sensor wiring and connectors.
    - step: 9
      text: Inspect the downlock mechanism for proper engagement and security.
    - step: 10
      text: Check the towing attachment points for damage or deformation.
    - step: 11
      text: Inspect the NLG retraction actuator for leaks and proper attachment.
    - step: 12
      text: Perform borescope inspection of internal cylinder walls per AMM 32-10-05.
    - step: 13
      text: Inspect NLG axle for cracks using approved NDT method per AMM 32-10-10.
    - step: 14
      text: Lubricate all grease fittings according to the lubrication chart in AMM 12-20-00.
