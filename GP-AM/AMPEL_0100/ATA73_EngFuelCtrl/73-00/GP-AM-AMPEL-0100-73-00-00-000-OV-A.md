# Engine Fuel & Control System Overview - ATA 73

## 1. Document Purpose

This document provides a high-level technical overview of the Engine Fuel & Control system for the GGT-205H propulsion unit. It describes the system's architecture, primary functions, and control logic, with a specific focus on the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) and its management of the hybrid Liquid Hydrogen (LH₂) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) sources.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 General Description

The ATA 73 system is the control authority for the GGT-205H engines. It is a dual-channel, fault-tolerant system designed for maximum safety, reliability, and efficiency. Its core component is the FADEC, which provides the authoritative **fuel/actuator scheduling** and **protection limits** (surge, EGT, rotor speed), executing thrust commands within certified envelopes.

### 2.2 Key Functions

-   Automated engine start and shutdown sequencing.
-   Thrust setting and limiting based on pilot input and flight phase.
-   Engine surge and stall protection.
-   Transient fuel scheduling for acceleration and deceleration.
-   Health monitoring and fault reporting to the `i-Aher0` AI core and CMS.
-   **Management of the hybrid LH₂/SAF fuel sources.**

### 2.3 Hybrid Fuel Control Logic

The management of two distinct fuel types is the system's most critical function. The baseline operational philosophy is a state-machine-driven process:
-   **Hybrid Transition State Machine:** Pre-Cruise(SAF) → Blend-In(SAF→GH₂; T_blend = ⟨30–60 s⟩) → Cruise(GH₂) → Blend-Out(GH₂→SAF; T_revert ≤ ⟨5 s⟩ on L1 fault) → Approach(SAF).
-   **State Guards (TBD):** leak < ⟨400 ppm⟩, P_H2 ∈ [⟨18⟩, ⟨28⟩ bar], ΔEGT ≤ ⟨30 °C⟩/s, ΔSM ≥ ⟨4%⟩.

### 2.4 Start & Relight Policy

-   **Start/Relight Fuel:** All ground starts, air starts, and windmill relights are performed exclusively on SAF. Windmill relight envelope is targeted for ⟨250–400 kt⟩ / ⟨FL100–FL300⟩ on SAF.
-   **H₂ Relight:** Not permitted in the baseline design (blocked in FADEC tables).

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC)

A dual-channel (A and B), self-monitoring computer mounted on the engine casing. Each channel can maintain safe engine control; performance/feature degradations are annunciated via CAS to CMS per MMEL. Software (DO-178C DAL A) and hardware (DO-254 DAL A) are **partitioned per ARINC 653**, with DAL allocation derived from the **ARP4754A/ARP4761A** safety process. The system includes BIT/BITE on power-up and post-flight leak check routines.

### 3.2 Fuel Metering and Delivery

-   **LH₂ Sub-System:** Includes a cryogenic pump, heat exchanger/vaporizer, and Fuel Metering Valve (FMV).
-   **SAF Sub-System:** Includes a traditional high-pressure fuel pump and a dedicated FMV.
-   **Purge & Inerting:** The system incorporates a **GN₂ purge** (from onboard bottles) before GH₂ admission and at cutoff. Features **dual-wall cryo lines** with GN₂ annulus and **overboard vent** routing. Hazardous-zone classification per ARP5414/5416; leak-before-burst design for cryo lines.

### 3.3 Actuation and Sensing

The FADEC receives data from a suite of engine sensors (ATA 77). Critical sensors for hybrid operation include **H₂ detectors (ppm)**, line **P/T sensors**, heat exchanger **ΔT**, and **Coriolis flow sensors** on both fuel lines.
